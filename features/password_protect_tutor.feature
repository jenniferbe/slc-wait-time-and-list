Feature: password protect data for tutor
  As a tutor
  So that no random user can see the data on the student line page
  I want the queue data to be password protected

  Background: Setup
    Given I am on the app firewall page
    When I fill in the password correctly for the app firewall page
    Then I should be on the sign up page

  Scenario: Sign in happy path
    Given I am on the tutor firewall page
    When I fill in the password correctly for the tutor firewall page
    And I should be on the student line page

  Scenario: Sign in sad path
    Given I am on the tutor firewall page
    When I fill in the password incorrectly for the tutor firewall page
    Then I should be on the tutor firewall page
    And I should be told that the password is incorrect
