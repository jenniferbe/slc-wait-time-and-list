#Feature: History
#  As an administrator
#  So that I can better quantifiably understand how the slc operates
#  I want to see a compilable history
#
#
#Scenario: View one day history
#  Given I am on the history page
#  And I select "11/09/17" from "history_dates"
#  Then I should see the history for "11/09/17"
#
#Scenario: Download one day's worth of history
#  Given I am on the history page
#  And I click "Download"
#  Then I should see "Download successful"
