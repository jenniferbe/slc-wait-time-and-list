Feature: view next student in line
  
  As a tutor
  So that I can decide which student to work with
  I want to see who is next in line
  Background: student requests in database

    Given I am on the app firewall page
    Then I fill in the password correctly for the app firewall page
    Given I am on the tutor firewall page
    Then I fill in the password correctly for the tutor firewall page

    Given the following student queues exist:
      | sid        | first_name | last_name | created_at              | meet_type   | status   |
      | 25804240   | Alex       | Yang      | 2012-09-10 14:44:24 UTC | drop-in     | waiting  |
      | 00000000   | Haggai     | Kaunda    | 2011-09-10 14:44:24 UTC | drop-in     | waiting  |
      | 25804241   | Maiki      | Rainton   | 2013-09-10 14:44:24 UTC | drop-in     | waiting  |
      | 25804242   | Nahrae     | Seok      | 2014-09-10 14:44:24 UTC | drop-in     | waiting  |


Scenario: list of students in line
  #   Given I am logged in as a tutor
  Given I am on the student line page
  Then I should see a list of students
 
# Scenario: see no students
#   Given I am logged in as a tutor
    And I am on the student line page
    Then I should see "Alex Yang" before "Maiki Rainton"
    And I should see "Alex Yang" before "Nahrae Seok"
