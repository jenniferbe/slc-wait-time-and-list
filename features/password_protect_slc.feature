Feature: password protect slc sign in
As a SLC admin
So that students must sign in physically at the SLC
I want the sign in portal to be password protected

Scenario: Sign in happy path
  Given I am on the app firewall page
  When I fill in the password correctly for the app firewall page
  Then I should be on the sign up page


Scenario: Sign in sad path
  Given I am on the app firewall page
  When I fill in the password incorrectly for the app firewall page
  Then I should be on the app firewall page
  And I should be told that the password is incorrect

  #need to be rspec
#Scenario: Refresh happy path
#  Given I am on the sign up page

#Scenario: Refresh sad path
#  Given I am on the sign up page
#  And I am not signed in to the app
